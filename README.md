  We presented WayFASTER, a novel method for self-supervised traversability estimation that uses sequential information to predict a map that improves the traversability map visibility. For such, we use a neural network model that takes a sequence of RGB and depth images as input, and uses the cameraâ€™s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to project the information to a 3D space and predict a 2D traversability map.

```

### Debugging with Weights & Biases

This project leverages Weights & Biases (wandb) for comprehensive experiment tracking and debugging.

- Before using wandb in your project, you need to sign up for an account on the [Weights & Biases website](https://wandb.ai/).

- Once signed up, run:
  ```shell
  wandb login
  ```
  And follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your wandb account.

## Experimental results

<p align="justify">
  As we can see in the figure above, WayFASTER was the most successful method among the three. The WayFAST approach wast not able to reach the final goal in most of the experiments, often failing when performing the final sharp turn. Our hypothesis is that, since the method could only use a narrow field-of-view, it was not able to respond in time when doing sharps turns, since obstacles would suddenly appear. LiDAR-based navigation and our method WayFASTER were able to successfully complete the whole path. This is because both these methods have wider field-of-view. However, WayFASTER was able to complete the path in less time, which is a good indication that it was able to predict the traversability map more accurately.

| Method       | Success   | Avg. time (s) |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| LiDAR-based  | 5/5       | 201           |
| WayFAST      | 1/5       | -             |
| WayFASTER    | 5/5       | 118           |
